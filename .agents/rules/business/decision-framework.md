# Decision Framework

## Purpose

Provide structured frameworks for business decision-making and documentation.

## Decision Types and Approaches

### Strategic Decisions (High Impact, Long-term)
- Market positioning
- Business model changes
- Major investments
- Partnerships
- Pivots

**Approach**: Thorough analysis, stakeholder input, scenario planning

### Tactical Decisions (Medium Impact, Medium-term)
- Feature prioritization
- Resource allocation
- Process changes
- Technology choices

**Approach**: Data-driven, quick analysis, reversible when possible

### Operational Decisions (Low Impact, Short-term)
- Day-to-day choices
- Minor adjustments
- Implementation details

**Approach**: Quick, delegated, based on principles

## Go/NoGo Decision Framework

### Pre-Decision Checklist
□ Clear decision criteria established
□ All options identified
□ Data gathered and analyzed
□ Stakeholders consulted
□ Risks assessed
□ Resources evaluated
□ Timeline considered

### Go Criteria (Must meet majority)
✓ Strong market validation
✓ Clear value proposition
✓ Feasible with available resources
✓ Aligned with business goals
✓ Acceptable risk level
✓ Competitive advantage identified
✓ Positive projected ROI

### NoGo Criteria (Any one may trigger NoGo)
✗ Weak or no market validation
✗ Unclear value proposition
✗ Resource constraints too severe
✗ Misaligned with strategy
✗ Unacceptable risks
✗ No sustainable advantage
✗ Negative or unclear ROI

### Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Market demand | High | | |
| Feasibility | High | | |
| ROI potential | Medium | | |
| Strategic fit | Medium | | |
| Risk level | Low | | |

**Decision Rule**: Total weighted score > threshold (e.g., 70%) = Go

## Decision-Making Models

### 1. RAPID Framework
- **R**ecommend: Who recommends action
- **A**gree: Who must agree
- **P**erform: Who performs the work
- **I**nput: Who provides input
- **D**ecide: Who makes final decision

### 2. OODA Loop (Fast Decisions)
- **O**bserve: Gather information
- **O**rient: Analyze situation
- **D**ecide: Choose course of action
- **A**ct: Execute decision

### 3. Pros/Cons Analysis
For each option:
- List all pros
- List all cons
- Weight by importance
- Calculate net score
- Consider qualitative factors

### 4. Decision Tree
- Map out decision paths
- Assign probabilities
- Calculate expected values
- Choose highest expected value path

### 5. Eisenhower Matrix
- **Urgent & Important**: Do now
- **Important, Not Urgent**: Schedule
- **Urgent, Not Important**: Delegate
- **Neither**: Eliminate

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Identification
- Technical risks
- Market risks
- Financial risks
- Operational risks
- Competitive risks
- Legal/regulatory risks

### Risk Analysis (2x2 Matrix)

**Probability × Impact**

| | Low Impact | High Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **High Probability** | Monitor | Mitigate Immediately |
| **Low Probability** | Accept | Contingency Plan |

### Risk Response Strategies
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Insurance, partnerships
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor

## Data-Driven Decision Making

### Key Metrics to Consider
- Customer metrics (CAC, LTV, Churn)
- Product metrics (Usage, Engagement, Retention)
- Business metrics (Revenue, Margins, Growth)
- Market metrics (Size, Share, Trends)

### Data Quality Checklist
□ Data is recent and relevant
□ Sample size is adequate
□ Sources are credible
□ Bias is minimized
□ Assumptions are explicit
□ Alternative interpretations considered

## Bias Awareness

### Common Cognitive Biases
- **Confirmation bias**: Seeking confirming evidence
- **Anchoring bias**: Over-relying on first information
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing due to past investment
- **Optimism bias**: Overestimating success probability
- **Groupthink**: Conformity over critical thinking

### Bias Mitigation
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Use structured decision frameworks
- Get diverse perspectives
- Challenge assumptions
- Use pre-mortems (imagine failure, work backwards)

## Decision Documentation Template

```markdown
# Decision: [Title]

## Context
[Background and situation]

## Decision Statement
[What was decided - clear and concise]

## Options Considered
1. **Option A**: [Description]
   - Pros: [List]
   - Cons: [List]

2. **Option B**: [Description]
   - Pros: [List]
   - Cons: [List]

## Decision Rationale
[Why this option was chosen]

## Key Factors
- Factor 1: [Description and weight]
- Factor 2: [Description and weight]

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk 1: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]
- Risk 2: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]

## Success Criteria
- [How to measure success]
- [Key metrics]

## Next Steps
1. [Action item 1] - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]
2. [Action item 2] - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]

## Review Date
[When to review this decision]
```

## Fast Decision Making (Reversible Decisions)

### Two-Way Door Decisions (Reversible)
- Make quickly
- Gather minimum viable data
- Bias toward action
- Iterate and adjust

### One-Way Door Decisions (Irreversible)
- Take time needed
- Gather comprehensive data
- Consider long-term impact
- Use rigorous framework

## Group Decision Making

### Effective Meeting Structure
1. **Frame**: Define decision and criteria
2. **Gather**: Present data and options
3. **Discuss**: Debate pros/cons
4. **Decide**: Make decision (consensus or designated decider)
5. **Document**: Record decision and rationale

### Consensus Building
- Ensure all voices heard
- Address concerns
- Seek win-win solutions
- Be willing to disagree and commit

### When Consensus Fails
- Designated decision maker decides
- Document dissent
- Commit to decision once made

## Post-Decision

### Communication
- Announce decision to stakeholders
- Explain rationale
- Address concerns
- Set expectations

### Execution
- Assign responsibilities
- Set deadlines
- Track progress
- Adjust as needed

### Review and Learn
- Schedule decision review
- Measure against success criteria
- Capture lessons learned
- Update decision process

## Quality Checklist

□ Decision clearly stated
□ Context fully documented
□ All options considered
□ Data analyzed objectively
□ Risks identified and addressed
□ Success criteria defined
□ Stakeholders consulted
