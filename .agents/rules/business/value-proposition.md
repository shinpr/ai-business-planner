## Purpose

Design compelling value propositions using the Value Proposition Canvas framework.

## Value Proposition Canvas

### Customer Profile

#### Customer Jobs
- **Functional Jobs**: Tasks customers are trying to get done
- **Social Jobs**: How customers want to be perceived
- **Emotional Jobs**: How customers want to feel
- **Supporting Jobs**: Ancillary tasks in context of main job

#### Pains
- **Undesired outcomes, problems, characteristics**: What frustrates customers?
- **Obstacles**: What prevents customers from getting job done?
- **Risks**: What could go wrong?
- **Severity**: Rate from moderate to extreme

#### Gains
- **Required gains**: Minimum expectations
- **Expected gains**: What customers expect
- **Desired gains**: What would delight customers
- **Unexpected gains**: What exceeds expectations

### Value Map

#### Products & Services
- List of products and services creating value
- What you offer to help customers get jobs done

#### Pain Relievers
- How your products/services eliminate or reduce pains
- Address specific customer pains identified
- Rank by importance to customer

#### Gain Creators
- How your products/services create customer gains
- Describe how you deliver benefits
- Rank by relevance to customer

## Fit Assessment

## Value Proposition Statement Template

**For** [target customer]

**That** [key benefit, reason to buy]
**Unlike** [primary competitive alternative]

## Application Guidelines

### For Business Planning
1. Start with deep customer understanding
2. Identify most critical pains to solve
3. Define most valuable gains to deliver
4. Design products/services that address both
5. Validate with target customers
6. Refine based on feedback

### For MVP Definition
Focus on:
- Most critical customer job
- Most severe pain to relieve
- Most important gain to create
- Minimal features needed to deliver value

### For Competitive Differentiation
- Identify what competitors don't address well
- Find unique angle on pain relief or gain creation
- Emphasize sustainable advantages
- Validate differentiation with customers

## Common Value Proposition Patterns

### Convenience/Time-Saving
- Pain: Process is time-consuming, complex
- Gain: Save time, simplify workflow
- Example: "Get X done in minutes instead of hours"

### Cost Reduction
- Pain: Current solution is expensive
- Gain: Reduce costs, improve ROI
- Example: "Cut costs by X% while maintaining quality"

### Performance/Quality
- Pain: Current solutions underperform
- Gain: Better results, higher quality
- Example: "Achieve X% better results with our solution"

### Risk Mitigation
- Pain: High risk of failure or errors
- Gain: Reduce risk, increase reliability
- Example: "Eliminate risk of X with our proven system"

### Accessibility/Democratization
- Pain: Solution only available to few
- Gain: Make available to many
- Example: "Enterprise-grade X for everyone"
