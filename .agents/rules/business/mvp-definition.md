# MVP Definition

## Purpose

Define Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope using lean startup principles and feature prioritization frameworks.

## MVP Philosophy

**MVP is NOT:**
- A low-quality product
- Just the first release
- Everything customers might want

**MVP IS:**
- Minimum features to validate core hypothesis
- Fastest path to learning
- Focus on core value delivery
- Starting point for iteration

## MVP Definition Framework

### 1. Core Hypothesis
Define what you need to validate:
- Will customers pay for this solution?
- Does this solve the core problem?
- Will customers use this feature?
- Can we deliver value at this price point?

### 2. Core Value Identification
- What is the ONE thing users cannot live without?
- What problem MUST be solved?
- What creates the most value with least effort?
- What validates our business model?

### 3. Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW Method)

#### Must Have (Critical for MVP)
- Core functionality
- Without it, product has no value
- Directly solves primary pain point
- Essential for value proposition

#### Should Have (Important but not critical)
- Important features
- Enhance user experience
- Can be added soon after MVP
- Nice to have for complete experience

#### Could Have (Nice to have)
- Desirable features
- Low priority
- Future enhancements
- Not needed for initial validation

#### Won't Have (Out of scope)
- Explicitly excluded
- Future consideration
- Not aligned with core value
- Can be done differently

### 4. Alternative Prioritization: RICE Score

**RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

- **Reach**: How many users affected (per time period)
- **Impact**: How much it impacts value (Minimal=0.25, Low=0.5, Medium=1, High=2, Massive=3)
- **Confidence**: How certain are you (Low=50%, Medium=80%, High=100%)
- **Effort**: Time/resources required (person-months)

Higher RICE score = Higher priority

### 5. User Story Mapping

Create user journey and identify:
- **Backbone**: Main user flow (horizontal)
- **Walking Skeleton**: Minimum viable journey
- **Must-Haves**: Essential steps in journey
- **Nice-to-Haves**: Enhancement to journey

## MVP Scoping Process

### Step 1: Identify Core Problem
- What is the primary pain point?
- What are users struggling with most?
- What creates the most friction?

### Step 2: Define Success Criteria
- What metrics indicate success?
- What user behavior validates hypothesis?
- What business metrics matter?

### Step 3: List All Potential Features
- Brainstorm everything users might need
- Include all ideas, no filtering yet

### Step 4: Apply MoSCoW Prioritization
- Categorize each feature
- Be ruthless: when in doubt, Should Have or Could Have
- Focus on Must Haves only for MVP

### Step 5: Validate Scope
- Can this be built in reasonable time?
- Does this deliver core value?
- Can we test our hypothesis with this?
- Is there a simpler way?

### Step 6: Define MVP Roadmap
- MVP (Must Have only)
- V1.1 (Must Have + top Should Haves)
- V1.2 (Remaining Should Haves)
- V2.0 (Selected Could Haves)

## MVP Patterns

### Concierge MVP
- Manual delivery of service
- Validate demand before automation
- Example: Manually curate recommendations before building algorithm

### Wizard of Oz MVP
- Automated frontend, manual backend
- Validate user experience before full build
- Example: Chat interface with human behind it

### Single-Feature MVP
- One core feature done extremely well
- Validate feature-market fit
- Example: Instagram started with just photo filters

### Landing Page MVP
- Describe value proposition
- Measure interest via sign-ups
- Validate problem before building

## Scope Reduction Techniques

### Remove Features
- Question every feature
- Remove if not critical
- Defer to post-MVP

### Simplify Features
- Reduce complexity
- Manual processes initially
- Limited use cases first

### Narrow Target
- Smaller user segment
- Specific use case
- Geographic limitation

## Quality Checklist

□ Core hypothesis clearly stated
□ Core value identified and validated
□ Features prioritized using MoSCoW or RICE
□ Must Haves are truly essential
□ Should Haves genuinely not critical
□ Success metrics defined
□ MVP scope realistic and achievable
□ MVP validates key assumptions
□ Clear path from MVP to full product
□ Scope reviewed and reduced where possible

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Feature creep**: Adding "just one more feature"
- **Perfectionism**: Making MVP too polished
- **Wrong priorities**: Including non-essential features
- **Scope too large**: MVP takes too long to build
- **No hypothesis**: Building without clear validation goal
- **Kitchen sink MVP**: Trying to serve everyone
