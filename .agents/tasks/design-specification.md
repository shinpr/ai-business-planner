## Execution Process

### Step 0: Interactive Information Gathering [IF NEEDED]

**Context**: This task usually follows requirements definition. Most information comes from requirements and business plan. However, users may have specific design preferences or constraints.

**NO ASSUMPTIONS ALLOWED**: Never infer, guess, or assume design preferences not explicitly provided by the user or documented in previous phases.

**Process**:
1. **Extract existing information** from:
   - Requirements document (primary source)
   - Business plan (brand/target audience)
   - User input and discussions
   - Provided design materials (if any)

2. **Identify gaps** in design-specific information (see checklist below)

3. **Interactive dialogue with user** (if gaps exist):
   - Ask specific questions for missing design information
   - Group questions by category (visual, UX, accessibility, etc.)
   - Wait for user response before proceeding
   - **NEVER fill gaps with assumptions**

4. **Skip this step if**:
   - Requirements contain sufficient design direction
   - No specific design preferences needed

**Required Information Checklist** (ask only if missing from previous documents):

**Design Vision** (SHOULD HAVE):
- [ ] Design philosophy or style preference (modern, minimal, bold, etc.)?
- [ ] Brand personality (if not in business plan)
- [ ] Design references or inspiration (if any)?
- [ ] Specific design constraints or preferences?

**Visual Elements** (SHOULD HAVE):
- [ ] Color preferences or brand colors?
- [ ] Typography preferences?
- [ ] Existing brand guidelines to follow?

**User Experience** (MUST HAVE):
- [ ] Primary device target (mobile-first, desktop-first)?
- [ ] Critical user flows that need special attention?
- [ ] Accessibility requirements (WCAG level, etc.)?

**Constraints** (IF APPLICABLE):
- [ ] Technical limitations affecting design?
- [ ] Platform-specific design requirements?

**PROCEED CONDITION**: All MUST HAVE items confirmed or marked as "TBD - designer's discretion based on best practices"

### Step 1: Understand User Needs

- Establish visual style

### Step 5: Document Design System
- List component needs
- Define spacing/layout
- Set grid system
- Specify responsive approach

### Step 6: Address Accessibility
- Set accessibility goals
- Define compliance level
- Plan inclusive design
- Test considerations

## Completion Conditions

□ Design vision clearly articulated
□ UI/UX concept defined
□ Visual design specified
□ Design system documented
□ Brand elements included (if applicable)
□ Accessibility requirements set
□ Responsive approach defined
□ Design supports requirements
□ Design deliverable for prompt generation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-designing for MVP** → Keep it simple and focused
2. **Ignoring accessibility** → Plan for inclusive design
3. **No responsive strategy** → Always consider multiple devices
4. **Inconsistent design system** → Define clear patterns
5. **Missing user context** → Design for actual user needs
6. **No brand consideration** → Include basic brand elements
7. **Vague specifications** → Be specific and actionable

## Exit Conditions

□ Design requirements document exists
□ All completion conditions satisfied
□ User approval obtained (STOP POINT in workflow)
□ Design ready to integrate into prompts
